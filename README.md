Ed does magic!                      |  Ed keeps bees!

In the eighteenth century, beekeeper Daniel Widmann appeared at Astley's Amphitheatre with a trained swarm of bees. They followed his assistant as she rode a horse around the arena, forming itself into a buzzing suit of armour around her body. There are no pictures of the event, and after his run came to an end, bee magic was never again seen in London.

Until now!

Ed Brims is London's second ever beekeeper-magician, and here's the sort of thing he does:
