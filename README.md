# 🪄🐝 Ed Brims - the beekeeper-magician 🐝🪄

I'm Ed Brims, and I perform magic with bees.

In the eighteenth century, beekeeper Daniel Widmann appeared at Astley's Amphitheatre

trained a swarm of bees to form itself into shapes and follow his assistant as she rode a horse around . After that bee magic was never again seen in London.

Until now!
