# My big fat Greek mythology family tree

This was my attempt as a student to draw a family tree of the whole of Greek mythology.

Some things about it:

* Roughly titans at the top, gods below, then humans filling the bottom half.
* Yes, it's a bit of an incestuous mess. Just look at Phaedra's mishaps, or how many ways Orestes was related to his wife Hermione.
* Double line for marriage, single line for extramarital flings.
    * Zeus got about a bit, and I couldn't link him to all of his conquests, so a vertical line with a Z means yet another of Zeus's offspring.
