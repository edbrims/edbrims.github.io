## Ed Makes Sense of Things

There have been moments over the last few decades when I haven't been thinking about magic or bees. In some of those moments, I have been trying to make sense of things that I donâ€™t understand.

Sometimes I have drawn myself silly diagrams or made lists or created stop-motion animations to explain them to myself.
